# Proto Mono Font

To complete the setup of the Proto Mono font, please add the following font files to this directory:

- ProtoMono-Light.woff2
- ProtoMono-Light.woff
- ProtoMono-Light.ttf

You will need to:
1. Obtain these files from your font provider
2. Place them in this directory (public/fonts/)
3. No further code changes are needed as the CSS is already set up to use these files

Once you've added the font files, the "GlassFund" text on the home page will display in the Proto Mono font.
